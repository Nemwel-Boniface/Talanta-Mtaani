# Talanta Mtaani

> "Talanta Mtaani" is a mock project I have done for my Microverse portal module. The project is about a music competition that aims to help the underprevileged young people to showcase their talents. With the hope that they will get a platform to sign deals and start producing professional music.
> The project consists of two pages:
- Home page
- About page
> "Talanta Mtaani" is a swahili word which can be roughly translated to "Talent In the area".
